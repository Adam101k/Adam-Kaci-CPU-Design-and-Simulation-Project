# Adam Kaci CPU Design and Simulation Project
In this project, I will design and simulate a simple 32-bit RISC-V CPU that implements a subset of the RV32I (32-bit base integer, little-endian) instruction set architecture (ISA). 

## Required Initial Setup

## How to run program

## AI Usage
AI was used for creating initial file structure setup "I need to setup my initial file structure". The suggestion was used to setup the initial pyproject.toml.
